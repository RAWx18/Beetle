1. Aim for the smallest code change that accomplishes the goal
2. Name new functions with clear, concise, user‑friendly, and optimized identifiers
3. Do not copy code exactly from other files or repositories; refactor or rewrite instead
4. Follow the principle of less is more: prioritize simplicity and readability
5. Avoid modifying existing code unless it is absolutely required
6. If modification of existing code is not possible, add new code with minimal impact
7. Structure new code so it integrates smoothly with the current architecture
8. Implement all functionalities required for a robust, opensource-ready solution. Ensure no demo or development mode features are present, and focus on optimization, reliability, and security for deployment.
