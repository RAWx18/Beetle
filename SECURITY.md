# Security Policy

We take the security of this project seriously and are committed to ensuring a safe and reliable experience for all contributors and users.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this repository, please report it **privately and responsibly** using the following steps:

1. Go to the **Security** tab of this repository on GitHub.
2. Click on **"Report a vulnerability"**.
3. Provide a clear and detailed description of the issue, including:
   - A summary of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
   - Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
   - A Proof of Concept (PoC), if available.

Once your report is submitted, we will:

- Acknowledge receipt promptly.
- Investigate and assess the issue.
- Work on a fix and notify you once resolved (where appropriate).

Please **do not disclose** any security issues publicly (e.g., issues, discussions, or forums) until we have had a chance to review and address the issue responsibly.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- All source code and configuration files within this repository.
- Any actively maintained dependencies managed by the Beetle team.

If the vulnerability is found in an external dependency that is not maintained by us, we recommend following that project's security disclosure process.

## Limitations

While we strive to maintain a high standard of security, please note:

- There may be limitations on response time due to available resources.
- Not all reported issues may result in changes or fixes.

## Thank You

Your help in responsibly disclosing security issues ensures that this project — and the open-source ecosystem as a whole — remains secure for everyone. We appreciate your support.
